## Gender Imbalance is a thing.

* 22.5% of UK Computing Students are Female (http://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2014/dec/30/girls-studying-stem-subjects-women-in-computing)
* 14.4% of UK STEM workforce & 17.5% of UK IT Professionals (https://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/resources/2015/09/women-in-the-stem-workforce)


## Why does it exist?

* Myth: Women Aren't Interested
* Myth: Less inclined towards IT
  * Because women are discouraged to pursue a technical career by society
  
## Why is it bad?

* Over half the population has been told that tech is not for them. That building the future does not include them, nor can they have access to the wages and opportunies of this workforce. This is morally wrong.
* Diverse teams produce better results - Examples

## Why do WE address this issue

* We address it because we recognise that tech is not a meritocracy
* Positive descrimination
* We're doing this because women are one of the largest groups underrepresented in IT
